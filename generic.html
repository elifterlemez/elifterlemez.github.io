								<strong><h2>What Makes a Good Manager?</h2>
								
								Having a good manager is almost the most important thing in the business environment. There are many managers, but not many good managers. Not everyone has the qualifications to be a good manager. Most good managers have innate leadership and communication skills. In my opinion, the most important ones are to have problem-solving skills and to be fair to employees.<br/><p></p>
							  Firstly, Ä±n our daily life, it is very normal to have a problem or even more than one problem at work. At such moments, managers must be calm. If you have a good manager, he or she will solve the problem with practical thinking. Also, good managers are focused on solving the problem and thinking about it so it doesn't happen again.<br/><p></p>
							  Another important feature of good managers is to be fair. We want to be rewarded for our hard work in every aspect of our lives. When we don't get this reward, we get angry and lose our motivation. Especially if the employees in the workplace cannot get paid for their labor, they may not be able to do a good job. At this point, managers should give the necessary value to their employees. What makes good managers good is that they care about their employees and protect their rights.<br/><p></p>
							  To sum up, those who want to be a good manager should be strong in the face of problems and should also care about the rights of their employees. So that the most important parts of being a good manager are accomplished.<br/>

							<strong><h2>Leader and Manager</h2>
							Wherever we work in our life we either have a manager or we have a leader among us.People who can be in managerial status can have distinctive features from leaders. There are many reasons for these differences, but the most crucial is that the manager is the most responsible person. Therefore, the two main differences between managers and leaders are the way they approach their employees and their way of thinking.<br/><p></p>
							Firstly, managers are quite different from leaders in the way they approach their employees and their thinking structure. The manager's focus is on system and order.Managers have short-term views Manager who holds an official position only instructs his employees.Managers also does things right.<br/><p></p>
							Secondly, on the other hand, the mindset of the leader and his attitude towards his employees are different. The leader thinks of the team that works before him and his focus is on people. Leaders have a long-term perspective. Instead of ordering the task to be done, he sets an example by doing it himself first.Leaders inspire and want to improve their employees. Leaders always do the right things and encourage them to do the right things.<br/><p></p>
							In brief, managers and leaders have differences in the way they think and approach their employees. In my opinion, these differences should be taken into account in order for the team working in a unit to be used efficiently. Even if someone with leadership qualities is put in a managerial position, a perfect organization takes place.<br/>
